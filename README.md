# Augmented-Reality-from-scratch
In this project series we are going to implement a series of project files, where at the end we will make a <b>Final Software</b> which will be capable to take 
a picture from us and augment any 3-D model or any other picture to the live video stream.</br></br>
<h2>First Module Details : (FEATURE DETECTION) </h2>

<ul>
<li>It explains the concept of Feature Detection and Description.
<li>Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) used, being Open Source.
<li>Feature detected and marked as green points in the image (meluha.jpg)
<li>Next video aim : To use the features for live stream feature matching.
